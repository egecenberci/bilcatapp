The application's final form can be found on the UnifiedBILCAT branch.

A more detailed description of my contribution to the project can be found in our final report, in section 3.2.11.

Bilcat is a mobile application created on Android Studio, that is used to track the pets' locations and their health status on Bilkent's campus. My contribution to this application was the map interface. The app hosts an interactive map, which was implemented using Google's Map Services. The user can add markers to the interactive map, which stores the previous markers added by various users. The markers are embedded with comments from the users, so that information on the pet's well-being may be provided. The pets' information and user comments were stored via Firebase.
